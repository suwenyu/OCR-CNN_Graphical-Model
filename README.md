# aml2020s_assign2

### Description
In this project we will continue to explore Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), but we will use additional image level features such as convolutions to aid the training. We will use PyTorch to implement our CRF model and convolutions.

### Dataset
The dataset is the same as the previous dataset from assignment 1. The original dataset is downloaded from http://www.seas.upenn.edu/âˆ¼taskar/ocr. 

### Environments and required packages
```bash
$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.4

$ pip3 install torch
$ pip3 install numpy
```

### How to run
